# pi-blitz

## Current status

Pre-alpha / local CLI review-passed. As of 2026-04-27, standalone `blitz` passed `gpt-5.5` xhigh review for controlled local testing. Use with undo/review discipline; public/release usage waits for Pi-stream telemetry and the 10-case benchmark.

## When to use

Use when:

- Target edit is AST-scoped: a function, method, class, variable.
- You can describe the edit as "replace the body of `X`" or "insert this right after `X`".
- You want a smaller output token footprint and can review/undo the result.

## When NOT to use

- Full-file rewrites — use core `write` / `edit`.
- Text-`oldText/newText` edits that aren't symbol-scoped — use `pi-mono-multi-edit`.
- Quick one-line changes where reading + edit is faster than symbol resolution.
- Files whose language is not yet supported by blitz (check `pi_blitz_doctor`).

## Tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `pi_blitz_read` | AST structure summary of a file (imports + L-range definitions). |
| `pi_blitz_edit` | Single symbol-anchored edit. Exactly one of `after`/`replace`. |
| `pi_blitz_batch` | Multiple symbol-anchored edits in one file. |
| `pi_blitz_rename` | AST-verified rename in one file (skips strings/comments). |
| `pi_blitz_undo` | Revert the last blitz edit on a file. Requires `confirm: true`. |
| `pi_blitz_doctor` | Report version, grammars, cache health. |

## Snippet grammar

Three ways to preserve unchanged body when you don't want to rewrite the whole symbol:

1. **`// ... existing code ...`** (and language-matching `#`/`/* */` variants) — fastedit-compatible lazy marker.
2. **`// @keep`** — strict marker, recommended for unambiguous edits.
3. **`// @keep lines=N`** — numeric anchor, least ambiguous.

If you do not use a marker, the snippet is treated as a **full replacement** of the target symbol body. Marker behavior has local golden-output coverage but still needs broader benchmark coverage.

## Examples

### Wrap a function in try/catch

```ts
pi_blitz_edit({
  file: "src/app.ts",
  replace: "handleRequest",
  snippet: `  try {
    // @keep
  } catch (e) {
    logger.error(e);
    throw e;
  }`,
});
```

For `replace`, pass only the symbol name in `replace`; the `snippet` is the replacement body. Do not repeat the function signature unless you already have it handy — blitz preserves it automatically.

### Insert a helper after a symbol

```ts
pi_blitz_edit({
  file: "src/app.ts",
  after: "handleRequest",
  snippet: `function healthCheck() {
  return { ok: true };
}`,
});
```

### Rename across a file

```ts
pi_blitz_rename({
  file: "src/app.ts",
  old_name: "oldName",
  new_name: "newName",
});
```

## Error handling

- `isError: true` with `details.reason = "no-undo-history"` — no previous edit to revert.
- `isError: true` with `details.reason = "no-occurrences"` — rename/edit target not found.
- `details.warning = "partial-edit"` — write succeeded but some chunks rejected; run `pi_blitz_diff` (v0.2) to review.
- Hard throws (shown in Pi as tool errors): binary missing, timeout, path escapes cwd, invalid params.

## Fallback to core `edit`

When blitz emits `{ "status": "needs_host_merge", ... }` as a single-line JSON payload, the target change can't be applied deterministically. Use the payload fields (`byteStart`, `byteEnd`, `excerpt`) to call core `edit` with a minimal context window — do not repeat the whole file.
